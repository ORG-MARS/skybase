# Contribution guidelines

Firstly, thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This project is powered by the community
and relies on hackers across the globe to report bugs, send suggestions and contribute code to move this project forward.

You can see a list of contributors **[here](./CONTRIBUTORS.md)**

## Ways to contribute

* **#1**: Report bugs üêû
* **#2**: Give us ideas üí°
* **#3**: Send patches

## Coding guidelines üë©‚Äçüíª üë®‚Äçüíª 

### Special comments

* `FIXME(@<username>)` : Use this when you have made an implementation that can be improved in the future, such as improved efficiency
* `HACK(@<username>)` : Use this when the code you are using a temporary workaround
* `TODO(@<username>)` : Use this when you have kept something incomplete
* `UNSAFE(@<username>)` : Use this to explain why the `unsafe` block used is safe

### Comment style

We prefer to use a 'mixed' commenting style: a cross between the C and C++ styles. 
Generally, if a comment can be explained in one-line, then follow the C++ commenting style.
In other cases, use the C style.

### Formatting

* All Rust code should be formatted using `rustfmt`

### Parts of the project

* `ci` , `.github` : CI scripts (which, under normal circumstances, don't need to be modified)
* `cli` : Source for `skysh` which is the command-line client for Skybase
* `examples` : Example configuration files
* `libsky` : This contains functions, structs, ... used by both the `cli` and the 
* `server` : Source for the main database server ``
* `sky-bench` : The source for the benchmarking tool resides here
* `sky-macros` : The source for custom compiler macros used by Skybase

### Jargon

Each project has its own jargon ‚Äî and so do we!

* _actiondoc_ and _actions docs_ : This refers to the `actions.jsonc` file, which is used by the Skybase documentation website for automatically building documentation for the actions

### Branches

The `next` branch is the _kind of_ stable branch which contains the latest changes. However, for most purposes, you should always download sources from the tags. Usually, when a feature is worked on, the work will be done on a separate branch, and then it will be merged into next.

## Steps

1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes and start a pull request
3. Sign the CLA (if you haven't signed it already)
4. One of the maintainers will review your patch and suggest changes if required
5. Once your patch is approved, it will be merged into the respective branch
6. Done, you're now one of the [contributors](./CONTRIBUTORS.md) üéâ

## Testing locally

1. Install rust (stable)
2. Run `cargo build --verbose && cargo test --verbose`
3. That's it!
