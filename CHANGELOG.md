# Changelog

All changes in this project will be noted in this file.

## Version 0.5.0 [2020-11-19]

> This release introduces breaking changes!

* Command line configuration added to `tdb`
* âš  Positional arguments in `tsh` and `tdb-bench` have been removed
* `MKSNAP` now has an _enhanced version_ which enables snapshots to be created even if they're disabled on the server side
* If `BGSAVE` fails, no more writes will be accepted on the server side. All commands that try to modify data will return an internal server error
* `tdb-bench` now provides JSON output with the `--json` flag
* The `Dockerfile` was fixed to use command line arguments instead of the configuration file which caused problems
* The `enabled` key under the `snapshots` key in the configuration file has been removed

### Upgrading

* Users who ran `tsh` like `tsh 172.17.0.1 2003` will now need to run: 

``` shell
tsh -h 172.17.0.1 -p 2003
```

* Users who ran `tdb-bench` like `tdb-bench 10 100000 4` will now need to run:

``` shell
tdb-bench -c 10 -q 100000 -s 4
```

* To enable snapshots, you just have to add the key: there is no need for the `enabled` key. To disable snapshots, you just have to omit the `snapshot` key (block) from your configuration file

### Migrating existing clients

The Terrapipe protocol was revised and promoted to 1.0. This will cause all existing client implementations to break, since the protocol has changed fundamentally. The clients have to implement the [latest spec](https://terrabasedb.github.io/docs/Protocols/terrapipe).

## Version 0.3.2 [2020-08-07]

> No breaking changes

The `tsh` component printed the wrong version number. This has been fixed.

## Version 0.3.1 [2020-08-05]

> This release introduces breaking changes

This release fixes #7, #8. It also adds several under-the-hood optimizations greatly improving query performance.

### Migrating existing clients

The only significant change in the protocol is the new metalayout format: `#a#b#c` instead of the previously proposed `a#b#c#` .

### Disk storage format

The disk storage format was changed rendering existing binary data files incompatible. However, if you have any existing data - which is important, open an issue - because we'll be able to provide a tool that can help you easily migrate your existing datasets - with a one line command - so - no worries!

## Version 0.3.0 [2020-07-28]

> No breaking changes

This version enables persistence for stored data

## Version 0.2.0 [2020-07-27]

> This release introduces breaking changes

This release implements the latest version of the Terrapipe protocol.

### Migrating existing clients

All clients have to reimplement the Terrapipe protocol to match the [latest spec](https://terrabasedb.github.io/docs/Protocols/unsupported-tp).

## Version 0.1.0 [2020-07-17]

This release provides an experimental client and server implementation.
